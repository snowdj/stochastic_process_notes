title: "Exercise 3: Bayesian non-parametric density estimation"
category: 'Homework'
---


### Goal

In this exercise, you will implement an MCMC algorithm for Bayesian non-parametric density estimation. Various topics on Gibbs, conjugate models, Metropolis-Hastings and issues arising from implementation of probabilistic inference software will be touched on at the same time.

### Resources for this assignment

You are provided with a scaffold for this project, containing both code and most of the detailed instructions for the main parts of the assignment. See the [github page](https://github.com/alexandrebouchard/polya-scaffold) to see what you should do next in terms of implementation. We will also give more information at the labs.

### Data analysis

A few small datasets are provided in the repository, but they are fairly simple, synthetic and small (see right for an example). <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/circle-data.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px; float: right"/> 

I therefore recommend that you optionally pick a real dataset of your choice. For example, the city of Vancouver has some interesting datasets at [this address](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/index.htm), which you could use to model the density of anything from graffitis to heritage buildings. The [World Bank](http://datacatalog.worldbank.org/), [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html?format=&task=clu&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=&sort=nameUp&view=table), are also a classic source, let me know if you have other suggestions to add here.

### Optional theoretical questions

These questions are optional, but will help you understand the implementation part of this exercise.

- Derive the predictive distribution of the Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model. Make sure you formula can be computed in time linear in the number of tables.
- Fix one point $x\_0 \in \Xscr$. Let $F$ denote the unknown density modelled by the DPM. What is the Bayes estimator of $F(x\_0)$ for the mean squared error?

### Harder optional question and project ideas

This scaffold can be a good starting point to extend for a project. Robust extensions will be offered to integrate with the scaffold to release as an open source library.

#### Other tests for the correctness of the Gibbs sampler

Try some other strategies for testing the correctness of the sampler, for example:

- Enumerate all the partitions explicitly on a small example to check the sampler converges to the correct posterior.
- Look at this paper: [Geweke 2004](http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/pub/faculty/ferrall/quant/papers/04_04_29_geweke.pdf). You should be able to use the code from the first assignment if you want to try this idea.

#### Alternative to Gibbs

A simple alternative to Gibbs which can actually be shown to dominate Gibbs is described in this classic paper, [Peskun 1973](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2335011?uid=3739400&uid=2&uid=3737720&uid=4&sid=21103417657013). Try the idea in the CRP case to see if it makes the sampling more computationally efficient.

#### More!

I have many other suggestions, some of which I will cover in class, some of which I can tell you in person. Thing related to:

- High-$p$ regime: Rank one update and beyond.
- Other likelihoods, classic methods for non-conjugate cases; new, discretized methods for non-conjugate cases
- Objective comparison and combination of existing samplers: stick-breaking (truncated and auxiliary variable-based), collapsed.
- New samplers/moves (symmetrized, stick permutation, ...)


### Handing-in

Simply submit one zip file containing the whole git repository, called ``xxxxxx-ex3-q1.zip`` and one pdf with a short report of what you did, ``xxxxxx-ex3-q2.pdf``. Here ``xxxxxx`` should be replaced by your student number.

### Hints

You should get something of that form for the predictive distribution:
