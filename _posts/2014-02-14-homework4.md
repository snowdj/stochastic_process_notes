This is the last exercise instead of a combined set of two. Recall the policy that we will drop the lowest score, which means that the last exercise is essentially optional if you did all the other exercises so far. The due date is March 20.

The instructions of the exercise is at this Github page: [https://github.com/alexandrebouchard/conifer-scaffold](https://github.com/alexandrebouchard/conifer-scaffold)
