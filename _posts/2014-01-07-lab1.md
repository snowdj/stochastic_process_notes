### Plan for first lab

- Additional information on CTMCs
- How to get started writing the code in R:
  - How to create a ``run`` command
  - How to read command line argument
- Quick survey to determine what will be covered in next labs
- Logistics: checking everybody can log in the machines
  
### Notes from Seong: How to create ``run`` file for submission   

There are two ways to do this, you can choose whichever approach you prefer. I will assume that you 
are programming in R. 

1. Write your code in some file (for example, ``q1.r``). Write the following lines in ``q1.r`` for reading in the command line arguments:

  ``` r
  # below code loads the command line arguments to character vector ``args``
  args<-commandArgs(TRUE)
  dnaFilePath<-args[1]
  matrixFilePath<-args[2]
  
  # write your code here
  ```
  
  Create a file and name it as ``run`` without any file extension. Type the below line in the ``run`` file:

  ``` bash
  Rscript q1.r $1 $2
  ```
  
  To test that your program, you can execute the file ``run`` from the command line prompt:
	
  ```
	$ chmod 700 run # this command gives the owner of the file execution permission (as well as read and write)
	$ ./run dnafile.txt matrixFile.txt
  ```

  If you are using Java, the content of the ``run`` file would look different. Assuming that your code is written in a file named Question1.java and that you have compiled it to produce Question1.class file,
  it would look something like this:
  
  ``` bash
  java -cp . Question1 $1 $2
  ```
 
  I assumed that you are running the code from the directory that contains .class file. If not, replace the . (dot) above by the path that contains the .class file that you wish to execute.  
  
2. First, check where the ``Rscript`` program is located by typing the following at the command line prompt:

  ```
  $ which Rscript
  /usr/bin/Rscript
  ```

  Create a file and name it as ``run`` without any file extension. Place the below lines of code in the ``run`` file:

  ``` bash
  #!/usr/bin/Rscript

  args<-commandArgs(TRUE)
  dnaFilePath<-args[1]
  matrixFilePath<-args[2]
  
  # rest of your code goes here
  ```

### Lab activities to do by the next lab

- Setting up a java environment:

  1. Download [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
  2. Install [Java](http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) on your machine if it is not installed already
